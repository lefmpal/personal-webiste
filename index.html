        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>I am Eleftherios Baltzidis, a dedicated professional with over eight years of experience devoted to empowering individuals and uplifting communities. My career journey has led me to collaborate with esteemed organisations, including UN bodies, national and international entities, and governmental agencies, all of which have enriched my understanding and expertise in social protection and education. Interacting with individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds has profoundly expanded my horizons and deepened my understanding of social dynamics. Each encounter has offered unique insights into the intricate tapestry of human experiences, beliefs, and traditions. These interactions have shaped my worldview, fostering a profound appreciation for diversity and inclusion. By engaging with people from various walks of life, I have gained a nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities that different communities face. Traveling and photography is one of my greatest passions, and I have been fortunate to visit over 30 countries. This love for exploration has altered my worldview and has deepened my appreciation for diversity. I have taken the initiative to learn multiple languages, including English, French, basic German, Spanish, Arabic, Farsi, and others, enabling me to connect with people from various backgrounds on a more personal level. The highlight of my personal journey is undoubtedly the founding of the charity Entaxis – action for inclusion and education. It is my pride and joy, born out of a deep-seated desire to promote inclusion and provide educational opportunities for those in need. If you share my passion for social protection and education and are interested in collaboration, I would love to connect. Feel free to reach out to me for consultancy and project opportunities in these fields.</p>
